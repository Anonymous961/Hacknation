## About Project
Unclaimed provides users with unique QR codes for each object of the user. This QR generated can be downloaded and pasted on the objects. If by any chance the object is lost, anyone can simply scan the code. This will provide an email notification to the right owner with the time,date and location where the object was scanned. Along with that, the person who scanned gets the mail id of the owner to let them reach their object.
